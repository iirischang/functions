## Project 5: Functions
Hi, I'm Iris. This is the fifth project for the Typography & Interaction class (2024-2025). <br>
The project, titled Functions, explores how designers can guide users through structured decision-making using typography as a tool for interaction.
<br>
<br>
By creating a dynamic multi-step questionnaire with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I designed an experience that helps users discover the typefaces best suited to their design goals. From topic selection to visual application, every choice activates a responsive systemâ€”making fonts feel personal, purposeful, and fun to explore.

*Thanks for stopping by and trying it out!*
